<Note>
  Welcome to the [frozi.lol](http://frozi.lol) API documentation. This section covers all available endpoints related to users and associated functionality.
</Note>

## Welcome

The [frozi.lol](http://frozi.lol) API lets you interact with user-related data and features across the platform. It supports things like profiles, rankings, and more. Every endpoint is secured with API key authentication and returns JSON-formatted responses.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are **authenticated using Bearer tokens** passed as a **HTTP header**.

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer ..."
}
```

<Info>
  API keys are issued through the [frozi.lol](http://frozi.lol) Discord server. To get one, create a support ticket and share some basic info about your project, including what it does, how you intend to use the API, expected usage (like user count), and a link to your site if you have one.
